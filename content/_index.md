Hi there! I'm Ruizhe, a final year PhD student at the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/), [Imperial College London](https://imperial.ac.uk), working with [Prof. Wayne Luk](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wl/). My research is to make [Deep Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) (DNNs) run faster on [Field-Programmable Gate Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) (FPGAs), with a specific focus on [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler)-based techniques.

Before joining Imperial, I was an undergrad at [Peking University](https://pku.edu.cn) studying [computer science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn). My main research activity then was at the [Center for Energy-efficient Computing and Applications (CECA)](http://ceca.pku.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Yun Liang](https://ericlyun.github.io/). 

I am blessed to work with wonderful colleagues in the past few years: I was an intern at Facebook, London, and Preferred Networks, Tokyo; I've co-authored papers with many talented friends from various top research institutes (Imperial, MIT, TU Eindhoven, etc.) and companies (PFN and Google).

On many programming platforms I use the ID _kumasento_, specifically, [GitHub](https://github.com/kumasento). I do practice competitive programming recently, watch my [progress](https://clist.by/coder/kumasento/)! Some of my interesting GitHub stats:
