## Research Motivation

DNNs are running everywhere, and FPGAs can be reconfigured for every kind of devices with a good balance of performance and energy-efficiency: they should be a perfect match. However, FPGAs are hard to program for non-electronics engineers (like me!), and DNN researchers normally don't have a mindset of designing FPGA-friendly models. My research is to bridge the gap between these two worlds.
